Since then the economical, health and human cost has been enormous for the world. However, little work has been done to understand the transcriptional changes brought about by the virus in human hosts. We have compared COVID-19 positive samples with negative samples from Indian patients to better understand the host response.. We find many genes related to immune response up-regulated in the COVID-19 patients. Many of these are the usual response genes against the viral infection but type I interferon appears to be a key immune response activated against SARS-CoV-2. A large number of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated pointing towards translational arrest and down regulation of host mRNA during late infection. The down-regulated genes are well correlated with the clinical manifestations and symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection such as the loss of smell and taste. We also find evidence of altered gene expression profiles associated with systemic complications such as neurological disturbances and high insulin requirement. Finally, we have identified many lncRNAs being down-regulated during COVID-19 infections. A few of these lncRNAs have functional role in viral infection. However, to understand the functional role of other lncRNAs, we looked at the function of their closest gene, since lncRNA are believed to have cis functionality. Our analysis suggests a role for lncRNA in down-regulation of metabolic and developmental processes during COVID-19 infection. ## 3 DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mark that governs chromatin organization, cell identity, and gene expression. Here we describe a human methylome atlas, based on deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 39 cell types sorted from 205 healthy tissue samples. Replicates of the same cell type are &gt;99.5% identical, demonstrating robustness of cell identity programs to genetic variation and environmental perturbation. Unsupervised clustering of the atlas recapitulates key elements of tissue ontogeny, and identifies methylation patterns retained since gastrulation. Loci uniquely unmethylated in an individual cell type often reside in transcriptional enhancers and contain DNA binding sites for tissue-specific transcriptional regulators. Uniquely methylated loci are rare and are enriched for CpG islands, polycomb targets, and CTCF binding sites, suggesting a role in shaping cell type-specific chromatin looping. The atlas provides an essential resource for interpretation of disease-associated genetic variants, and a wealth of potential tissue-specific biomarkers for use in liquid biopsies. ## 4 Splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1) is one of the most frequently mutated spliceosomal components in cancer. Recent studies additionally imply an involvement of the wildtype protein in tumor progression, but the underlaying mechanism remains elusive. Here we report that SF3B1 acts as a coactivator for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α. SF3B1 directly interacts with HIF1a, augments HIF1a-HIF1b heterodimer binding to hypoxia response elements in vivo and enhances transactivation of HIF target genes. In human patients, primary patient cells and in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), efficient HIF1a-signalling relies on SF3B1. Monoallelic deletion of Sf3b1 in this mouse tumor model severely delays tumor initiation and development and diminishes HIF target gene transcription, glucose uptake and proliferation in corresponding tumor organoids in hypoxia, while splicing remains functional. Here, we define a subset of aggressive chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (chRCCs) able to transcriptionally compensate monoallelic SF3B1 loss, a feature that correlates with poor prognosis and lymph node spread and we show that the oncogenic hotspot mutation SF3B1K700E has reduced co-activation efficiency. Also, we report increased sensitivity of cells with low levels of SF3B1 to the HIF-inhibitor PX-478. These findings reveal a splicing-independent, tumor promoting function of SF3B1, important in the pathogenesis of PDAC and other cancers. ## overall_design ## 1 Single cell RNA-seq study of human psoriasis skin;\\t;\\t*** Submitter declares that the raw data will be deposited in the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) due to patient privacy concerns. ***;\\t ## 2 Differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq data from COVID-19 positive samples against COVID-19 negative control ## 3 To portray the genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation across a variety of cell types, we obtained 205 samples of freshly isolated healthy adult tissue samples from 137 consented donors undergoing a variety of surgical procedures (ages 3-83). We dissociated tissue samples into single cell suspensions, and used lineage-specific antibodies to cell type specific surface markers to FACS purify cell populations covering 39 primary cell-types. The purity of cell types was confirmed using RT-qPCR for cell type specific gene expression markers, and assessing known tissue-specific methylation markers when possible (Methods, Supplemental Fig. S1). We then subjected cell type-specific genomic DNA to WGBS and sequenced at a mean depth of &gt;30X, using 150bp-long paired-end reads, with an average fragment size of 174bp.;\\t;\\t&gt;&gt;&gt;Submitter states that raw data are not available due to patient privacy concerns&lt;&lt;&lt;;\\t;\\tPlease note that the records have been updated with the processed data generated with the *hg38* reference on May 17, 2022. ## 4 Panc1 cells were treated either with control siRNA (siCtrl) or siRNA targeting SF3B1 (siSF3B1). siCtrl cells were exposed to 1% O2 or 21% O2, siSF3B1 cells to 1% O2 for 8 hours. ## type pubmed_id ## 1 Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing 33958582 ## 2 Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing 34586723 ## 3 Methylation profiling by high throughput sequencing 36599988 ## 4 Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing 36001976 Questions per GSE What type of data is it?

However a search on the GEO website yielded the following record: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE264108. It indicates that the data set was submitted in 2024 and made public only in 2025. As mentioned during lecture, the cached version of GEO that is the basis of the GEOmetadb package hasn’t been updated in several years, meaning that GSE264108 likely couldn’t be found since it was published more recently and GEOmetadb hasn’t been updated yet. Hint: Sample labels are not standardized. Use robust keyword detection (e.g., control|normal|healthy|wild[- ]?type vs. tumou?r|cancer|patient|disease|mutant|treated). Inspect a few GSM rows if the automatic inference is uncertain. dbDisconnect(con) "],["next-week-next-steps.html", "Chapter 7 Next week / Next steps", " Chapter 7 Next week / Next steps Download one candidate series and its supplementary counts Document everything (session info, package versions) sessionInfo() ## R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu ## Running under: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3 ## LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.26.so; LAPACK version 3.12.0 ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 ## [4] LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8 ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C LC_ADDRESS=C ## [10] LC_TELEPHONE=C LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## time zone: Etc/UTC ## tzcode source: system (glibc) ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] dplyr_1.1.4 ggplot2_4.0.1 DBI_1.2.3 GEOmetadb_1.70.0 RSQLite_2.4.5 ## [6] R.utils_2.13.0 R.oo_1.27.1 R.methodsS3_1.8.2 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] bit_4.6.0 gtable_0.3.6 jsonlite_2.0.0 compiler_4.5.2 ## [5] BiocManager_1.30.27 highr_0.11 tidyselect_1.2.1 blob_1.2.4 ## [9] jquerylib_0.1.4 scales_1.4.0 yaml_2.3.11 fastmap_1.2.0 ## [13] R6_2.6.1 labeling_0.4.3 generics_0.1.4 knitr_1.51 ## [17] tibble_3.3.0 bookdown_0.46 RColorBrewer_1.1-3 bslib_0.9.0 ## [21] pillar_1.11.1 rlang_1.1.6 cachem_1.1.0 xfun_0.55 ## [25] S7_0.2.1 sass_0.4.10 bit64_4.6.0-1 pkgload_1.4.1 ## [29] otel_0.2.0 memoise_2.0.1 cli_3.6.5 withr_3.0.2 ## [33] magrittr_2.0.4 grid_4.5.2 digest_0.6.39 rstudioapi_0.17.1 ## [37] lifecycle_1.0.4 vctrs_0.6.5 evaluate_1.0.5 glue_1.8.0 ## [41] farver_2.1.2 rsconnect_1.7.0 rmarkdown_2.30 tools_4.5.2 ## [45] pkgconfig_2.0.3 htmltools_0.5.9 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
